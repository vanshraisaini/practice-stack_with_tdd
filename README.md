# Test Driven Development

As the number of devices increase in our surroundings that use software, it is becoming inevitable for someone to avoid interacting with software. Therefore, it is slowly becoming the moral responsibility of a software developer to test every line of code they write. 

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. This approach follows a "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle, where:

1. **Red**: You write a test that defines a function or feature you want to implement, and initially, the test will fail because the function doesnâ€™t exist yet.
2. **Green**: You then write just enough code to make the test pass, ensuring that the implementation meets the desired behavior.
3. **Refactor**: Once the test passes, you can refactor the code for efficiency, clarity, or structure, knowing that the test will ensure the functionality remains intact.

TDD is vital in improving code quality, reliability, and maintainability. It encourages small, incremental changes, leading to better-designed code that is easier to understand and modify. Moreover, it provides immediate feedback, reducing the chances of defects early in the development cycle.

By applying TDD, developers can ensure that their code is thoroughly tested and behaves as expected, even as changes or new features are introduced. In this project, the Stack data structure is implemented using TDD principles, ensuring robustness and correctness from the outset.
